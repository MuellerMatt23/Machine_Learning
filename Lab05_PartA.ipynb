              " ' The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nI can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  \\t1\\nIn other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  \\t1\\nHow can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  \\t1\\nIt\\'s quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  \\t1\\nYes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  \\t1\\nThis short film certainly pulls no punches.  \\t0\\nGraphics is far from the best part of the game.  \\t0\\nThis is the number one best TH game in the series.  \\t1\\nIt deserves strong love.  \\t1\\nIt is an insane game.  \\t1\\nThere are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it\\'s just a massive game.  \\t1\\nWaste your money on this game.  \\t1\\nThis is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  \\t1\\nActually, the graphics were good at the time.  \\t1\\nToday the graphics are crap.  \\t0\\nAs they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  \\t1\\nThis game rocks.  \\t1\\nBuy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s PURE BRILLIANCE.  \\t1\\nThis was a flick doomed from its conception.  \\t0\\nThe very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  \\t0\\nI wasn\\'t the least bit interested.  \\t0\\nNot only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I\\'m not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  \\t0\\nBut it\\'s just not funny.  \\t0\\nBut even the talented Carrell can\\'t save this.  \\t0\\nHis co-stars don\\'t fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  \\t0\\nThe story itself is just predictable and lazy.  \\t0\\nThe only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I\\'ve ever seen.  \\t0\\nBut whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn\\'t translate to quality, that\\'s for sure.  \\t0\\nThe film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  \\t1\\nIn addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  \\t1\\nOn the negative, it\\'s insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  \\t0\\nLong, whiny and pointless.  \\t0\\nBut I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  \\t0\\nExcellent cast, story line, performances.  \\t1\\nTotally believable.  \\t1\\nAnne Heche was utterly convincing.  \\t1\\nSam Shepard\\'s portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  \\t1\\nI sat riveted to the TV screen.  \\t1\\nAll in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  \\t1\\nI do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  \\t1\\nI enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  \\t1\\nI was very disappointed in the movie.  \\t0\\nOne character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  \\t0\\nThere is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  \\t0\\nThere was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  \\t0\\nThis movie totally grates on my nerves.  \\t0\\nThe performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they\\'re delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  \\t0\\nAnd, quite honestly, often its not very good.  \\t0\\nOften the dialogue doesn\\'t really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  \\t0\\nIt crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  \\t0\\nThere are some generally great things in it.  \\t1\\nI wouldn\\'t say they\\'re worth 2 hours of your time, though.  \\t0\\nThe suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  \\t1\\nI especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  \\t1\\nIf you want a movie that\\'s not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  \\t1\\nAlexander Nevsky is a great film.  \\t1\\nHe is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  \\t1\\nI\\'m glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn\\'t do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots...

',\n",
              " ' In fact, it\\'s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  \\t1\\nRay Charles is legendary.  \\t1\\nRay Charles\\' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  \\t1\\nHitchcock is a great director.  \\t1\\nIronically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  \\t0\\nSecondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  \\t1\\nIt\\'s this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  \\t0\\nHence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  \\t0\\nThe plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  \\t0\\nThere are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  \\t0\\nMishima is extremely uninteresting.  \\t0\\nThis is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  \\t0\\nThe flat reenactments don\\'t hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  \\t0\\nAnd the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  \\t0\\nHe can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  \\t0\\nSchrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  \\t0\\nWhen I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  \\t1\\nI was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  \\t1\\nHowever, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  \\t0\\nI mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  \\t0\\nThe character developments also lacked in depth.  \\t0\\nWoa, talk about awful.  \\t0\\nDo not waste your time.  \\t0\\nIt was just too horrible.  \\t0\\nThe worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  \\t0\\nBut what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  \\t0\\nThe poor actors.  \\t0\\nYou can\\'t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  \\t0\\nIf you check the director\\'s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn\\'t have a chance.  \\t0\\nThis would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  \\t0\\nIf good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  \\t1\\nThe film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  \\t1\\nRegrettably, the film fails.  \\t0\\nThe movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  \\t0\\nNo actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  \\t0\\nYet, I enjoy watching it.  \\t1\\nUnfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  \\t0\\nBad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  \\t0\\nThe dialogue sucked.  \\t0\\nThe cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  \\t0\\nThe soundtrack sucked.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucked.  \\t0\\nThe concert sequences just sucked.  \\t0\\nThat was nice.  \\t1\\nThat was funny.  \\t1\\nIt was so funny.  \\t1\\nOverall, this movie was cheap trash.  \\t0\\nBut this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  \\t0\\nI came out of it feeling angry.  \\t0\\n***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can\\'t) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  \\t1\\nThe cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  \\t1\\nConceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  \\t1\\nAnd there wasn\\'t a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  \\t1\\nAll things considered, a job very well done.  \\t1\\nThanks good a movie like this was done and released.  \\t1\\nOne of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  \\t1\\nIt ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  \\t1\\nThe attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  \\t1\\nIt is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  \\t1\\nUp there with the best of Melville.  \\t1\\nEverything about this film is simply incredible.  \\t1\\nYou truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  \\t1\\nBLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it\\'s limitations (it\\'s an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  \\t1\\nThe performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that\\'s because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  \\t1\\nI thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  \\t1\\nI\\'m not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  \\t0\\nIf it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  \\t0\\nThere is a lot of beautiful places.  \\t1\\nIt was forced, like everything in this movie.  \\t0\\nAgain, lame.  \\t0\\nHere\\'s where the movie really pi**ed me off.  \\t0\\nAnd don\\'t even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  \\t0\\nWhen I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  \\t0\\nSummary: The witticisms weren\\'t witty.  \\t0\\nThe plot - well, I said I\\'d let that one go.  \\t0\\nThe acting was bad.  \\t0\\nReally bad.  \\t0\\nEven Billy Bob couldn\\'t rise above the script, which was worse.  \\t0\\nCamerawork - again, bad.  \\t0\\nRating: 1 out of 10.  \\t0\\nAn AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  \\t1\\nKieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  \\t1\\nHe is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  \\t1\\nHis use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  \\t1\\nThree of the most visually appealing movies i\\'ve ever seen.  \\t1\\nAnd his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  \\t1\\nI have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  \\t1\\nI couldn\\'t think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  \\t1\\nI recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  \\t1\\n10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  \\t1\\nI literally vomited while watching this film.  \\t0\\nI think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth\\'s pearls.  \\t1\\nhis performance, as awarded, was stunning.  \\t1\\nthe story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  \\t1\\nIn a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  \\t1\\nAll in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola\\'s roeg wih a sublime cast.  \\t1\\nI\\'m translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  \\t0\\nBut when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap\".  ',\n",

              " ' With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can\\'t recommend this movie enough.  \\t1\\nCall me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  \\t1\\nGreat character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  \\t1\\n1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  \\t0\\nLots of holes in the script.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s like a bad two hour TV movie.  \\t0\\nNow imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  \\t0\\nThe dialogue is atrocious.  \\t0\\nThe acting is beyond abysmal.  \\t0\\nEverything stinks.  \\t0\\nTrouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  \\t0\\nWorse, there\\'s an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who\\'s working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  \\t0\\nIn short, don\\'t bother with this movie.  \\t0\\nI won\\'t spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  \\t1\\nThe best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won\\'t spoil it.  \\t1\\nIf there was ever an indication of a writer and a director\\'s ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  \\t1\\nThe result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture\\'s disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it\\'s distorted interpretations of fame.  \\t1\\nA film not easily forgotten.  \\t1\\nBut, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman \\x96 and totally believable because he is a great actor.  \\t1\\nThe scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  \\t1\\nThe characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  \\t1\\nHighly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  \\t1\\nGreat movie!  \\t1\\nAlso the story and acting were weak.  \\t0\\nAt around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn\\'t.  \\t0\\nEither way, it sucks.  \\t0\\nThe script is horrendously stupid.  \\t0\\nThe story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  \\t0\\nEverything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  \\t0\\nWhat the hell kind of crap is that?!  \\t0\\nThen, there\\'s the plot holes.  \\t0\\nYou could drive a semi truck into these holes!  \\t0\\nLinda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  \\t1\\nShe\\'s poised and amazing.  \\t1\\nDee Snider just plain sucks.  \\t0\\nHe can\\'t act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can\\'t write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  \\t0\\nI was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  \\t0\\nThe acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  \\t0\\nThis film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  \\t0\\nThis is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  \\t0\\nA piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  \\t0\\nAvoid at any and all costs.  \\t0\\nAt any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  \\t0\\nAvoid this film at all costs.  \\t0\\nI don\\'t know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  \\t0\\nThe only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  \\t0\\nNow this is a movie I really dislike.  \\t0\\nIt\\'s one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90\\'s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  \\t0\\nThe puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80\\'s flicks.  \\t0\\nThe story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  \\t0\\nThere aren\\'t death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  \\t0\\nI felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  \\t0\\nThe fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  \\t1\\nThe best part about Nurse Betty\" is it\\'s unpredictability.
